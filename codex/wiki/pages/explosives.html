                Your explosive ammo has two ranges, one is the full-damage range and the other is half-damage or AOE range.
                Anyone within the AOE range has a moment to react and try to mitigate the damage. 
                They can perform a DEX saving throw of 12+ your skill mod to quickly dodge to an open adjacent space and try to take less damage.

                            You can use a single explosive ammo from your inventory as a stationary trap, having it go off when anything gets within 2m of it. It will go unnoticed by hostiles unless they pass an Observation saving throw of 10 + your Espionage skill.
