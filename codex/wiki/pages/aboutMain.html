                About Kaleido RPG
            </h1>
            <p>
                Kaleido RPG is a "tabletop" RPG system set in outerspace.
                While most RPGs begin on paper and are then translated to an electronic format, this system was built with the electronic format in mind.
                By emphasizing an electronic format for the players and GM, more complex mechanics and calculations can be designed and performed automatically
                letting the players focus more on the design of their characters.
