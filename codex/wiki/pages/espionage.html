                            Roll against the highest passive perception of a group of lifeforms to attempt to not be noticed. Doesn't work if you've already been noticed. 
                            Lasts until you step into view or make a significant noise. You can also overhear hushed conversations up to 5m away. May grant bonus first attack.

                            You create a holographic image of yourself and program it to perform a specific action on repeat (e.g. walk, sit, say a single phrase, etc.). 
                            Will distract nearby intelligent lifeforms until something dirupts the believablility (e.g. being attacked, running into a wall, saying the same phrase over and over).
                            Does not work if the lifeform sees you create the decoy.

                            While sneaking, you may perform a single sneak attack to a single target with either a gun or melee weapon. 
                            You gain advantage to hit and deal double damage. You immediately become noticed by lifeforms you didn't attack.
